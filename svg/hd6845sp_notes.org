* Items

- Lxxx :: line
- Fxxx :: flip-flop

Named in arbitrary order.

Lxxx! is (hopefully...) their source. There should be only one for
each.

* Transient notes

** Structure above R11

What does this do? Exactly?

Divided into 5 subunits east-west

South unit: each subunit's contact state is:

| North state | SW input | SE input | R |
|-------------+----------+----------+---|
|           0 |        0 |        0 |   |
|           0 |        0 |        1 |   |
|           0 |        1 |        0 |   |
|           0 |        1 |        1 | 0 |
|           1 |        0 |        0 | 0 |
|           1 |        0 |        1 | 0 |
|           1 |        1 |        0 | 0 |
|           1 |        1 |        1 | 0 |

North unit, westmost:

| LAAH | SW in | SE in | NE out | E output |
|------+-------+-------+--------+----------|
|    0 |     0 |     0 |      1 |          |
|    0 |     0 |     1 |      0 |          |
|    0 |     1 |     0 |      0 |          |
|    0 |     1 |     1 |      0 |          |
|    1 |     0 |     0 |      0 |          |
|    1 |     0 |     1 |      0 |          |
|    1 |     1 |     0 |      0 |          |
|    1 |     1 |     1 |      0 |          |


Inputs from south are ~/RA4~ and unknown (R11 bit 4)?

Input from west is ~LAAH~

Output from north combines all bits in overall structure

Each unit has an output that feeds east (internal analogue of the
overall ~LAAH~ input)
